## HarvardX CS50W: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

### Course's link

See [here](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript).

### Final project

My final project is a restaurant website. Users are able to register and after login, user taken to a personalised dashboard where user can edit profile, change password, see orders and logout.

The project was built using Django as a backend framework and JavaScript as a frontend programming language. All generated information are saved in database (SQLite by default).

All webpages of the project are mobile-responsive.

#### Distinctiveness and Complexity

I have make models for all the relevant data and all the data including Profile, Team, Menu Categories, Menu Dishes, Orders and Contact details coming from database instead of just putting all the data in html file. This system makes easier for Superuser to add and delete data from its main dashboard.

Normal client or user without staff level or superuser clearance have its own dashboard with profile update, password change and order details can be viewed there.

Have a message page with nav tab in navbar, but this nav tab can only activate when user is superuser, otherwise this tab is hidden from normal users.

I tried to mix many features in this website like text, pictures, video, google maps. Website is totally responsive and utilize bootstrap framework.

#### Installation

- Install project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Dependencies include Django and Pillow module that allows Django to work with images.
- Make and apply migrations by running `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.
- Create superuser with `python manage.py createsuperuser`. This step is not optional as superuser is main website admin and controls all data import and booking and feedback messages.

- Go to website address and register an account.
